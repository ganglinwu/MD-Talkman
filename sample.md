# SwiftUI Development Guide

Welcome to **SwiftUI development**! This guide will help you get started.

## What is SwiftUI?

SwiftUI is Apple's *modern framework* for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.

### Key Benefits

- **Declarative syntax** - Describe what your UI should look like
- **Cross-platform** - Works on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS  
- **Live previews** - See changes in real-time

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Xcode project
2. Choose SwiftUI as your interface
3. Start building your first view

### Your First View

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name = "World"
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, \(name)!")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .padding()
            
            TextField("Enter your name", text: $name)
                .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

> Remember: SwiftUI views are value types, which makes them lightweight and efficient.

## Advanced Topics

- State management with `@State` and `@Binding`
- Navigation with `NavigationView`
- Lists and data binding
- Animations and transitions

For more information, check out the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui).

### Common Patterns

```swift
// Observable Object Pattern
class UserData: ObservableObject {
    @Published var username = ""
    @Published var isLoggedIn = false
}

// Environment Object Usage
struct MyView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var userData: UserData
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome, \(userData.username)")
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:

1. Clean your build folder (`Cmd+Shift+K`)
2. Restart Xcode
3. Check for typos in your code

### Preview Issues

> If previews aren't working, try restarting the preview canvas or checking your preview code for errors.
