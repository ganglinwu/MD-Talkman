# GitHub Integration Learning Guide - From Beginner to Implementation

**Project**: MD TalkMan Phase 2 - GitHub Integration  
**Timeline**: 7-9 weeks (Extended for GitHub Apps)  
**Level**: Beginner to Intermediate iOS Development  
**Date Created**: August 16, 2025  
**Updated**: August 19, 2025 - Pivoted to GitHub Apps for better granular permissions

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

Instead of diving into the complex full implementation, we'll build your skills progressively through small, educational projects that teach each concept individually before combining them.

**Key Principles**:
- ✅ **Understand before implementing** - Learn concepts first, code second
- ✅ **Build incrementally** - Small wins lead to big victories
- ✅ **Learn by doing** - Every concept gets a hands-on mini-project
- ✅ **Ask for help** - Get guidance when stuck for 2+ hours

- [x] Know how JWT tokens work for app authentication
- [x] Understand installation access tokens vs user access tokens
- [x] Understand webhooks and real-time sync capabilities
- [x] Ready to implement repository selection in MD TalkMan

## 🔧 Refined Implementation Requirements

Based on deep concept analysis, here are MD TalkMan's specific GitHub Apps requirements:

### Functional Requirements
✅ **Repository Management**
- Users can add repositories incrementally (no full reinstallation needed)
- Users modify repository access via GitHub settings page
- App syncs repository list periodically and on webhook events

✅ **File Scope & Security**  
- Limit access to `.md` and `.markdown` files only (principle of least privilege)
- Request minimal permissions: `contents:read`, `metadata:read`
- Enhanced user trust through clear, limited scope

✅ **Content Operations**
- Read markdown files for TTS playback
- Create/edit markdown files (user preference)
- Smart conflict resolution for concurrent edits

✅ **Commit Attribution**
- Default: Commits as "MD TalkMan App" (clear app identity)
- Optional: Commits as user (user preference in settings)
- Proper commit messages with app attribution

✅ **Real-time Sync via Webhooks**
- Push events: Sync when `.md` files change on GitHub
- Installation events: Handle repository additions/removals
- Offline resilience: Queue webhook events when app closed

### Technical Architecture

#### Authentication Flow
```
1. Installation: User → GitHub → mdtalkman://install?installation_id=12345
2. Authorization: User → GitHub → mdtalkman://auth?code=abc123  
3. Token Exchange: App JWT + code + installation_id → Installation Access Token
4. Repository Access: Installation token → Selected repositories only
```

#### Token Management
- **JWT Tokens**: 10-minute app authentication, signed with private key
- **Installation Tokens**: 1-hour repository access, automatically refreshed
- **User Tokens**: Long-lived user authorization (for commit attribution)

#### Webhook Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://your-server.com/webhooks/github` (requires server)
- **Events**: `push`, `installation`, `installation_repositories`
- **Processing**: Filter for `.md` file changes, trigger selective sync

#### Security Model
- **Private Key Storage**: Secure enclave or keychain for JWT signing
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic installation token renewal
- **Permission Scoping**: Repository-specific, file-type limited access

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: GitHub App Setup (Week 4)
- [ ] Create GitHub App with minimal permissions
- [ ] Configure webhook endpoints and events
- [ ] Generate and securely store private key
- [ ] Test installation flow with single repository

#### Phase 2: Authentication Implementation (Week 5)  
- [ ] Replace OAuth flow with GitHub App installation
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation and signing
- [ ] Handle installation and authorization callbacks
- [ ] Build repository selection and management UI

#### Phase 3: Webhook Integration (Week 6)
- [ ] Set up webhook server endpoint (or use GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Implement webhook event processing
- [ ] Add real-time file sync for `.md` changes
- [ ] Handle installation repository modifications

#### Phase 4: Core Data Integration (Week 7)
- [ ] Update repository and file discovery logic
- [ ] Implement incremental repository additions
- [ ] Handle file filtering for markdown-only access
- [ ] Add conflict resolution for concurrent edits

### 🚨 Webhook Server Challenge

**Important iOS Limitation**: iOS apps can't directly receive webhooks (no persistent server endpoint).

**Solution Options:**
1. **Polling Strategy**: Check for changes periodically (simpler, less real-time)
2. **Cloud Function**: Use Firebase/AWS Lambda as webhook proxy 
3. **GitHub Actions**: Trigger push notifications to your app
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Webhooks for immediate sync + polling as fallback

**Recommended for Learning**: Start with polling, add webhooks later for production.
