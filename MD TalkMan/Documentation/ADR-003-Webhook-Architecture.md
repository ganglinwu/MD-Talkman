# ADR-003: Go-based Webhook Server with APNs Integration

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: Development Team  

## Context

MD TalkMan requires real-time notifications when GitHub repositories are updated with new markdown content. Users should be notified on their iOS devices when repositories they're following receive new or updated markdown files, enabling immediate access to new content without manual checking.

The iOS app cannot directly receive webhooks due to iOS sandbox limitations and the requirement for persistent server endpoints. We needed to implement a webhook proxy architecture to bridge GitHub webhooks and iOS push notifications.

## Decision

**Implement a production-ready Go webhook server with the following architecture:**

```
GitHub Repository ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Go Server ‚Üí APNs ‚Üí iOS App
                                  ‚Üì
                             Signature Verification
                             Markdown Detection
                             Device Management
```

### Key Components:
1. **Go HTTP Server** with production deployment on EC2
2. **GitHub Apps Integration** with JWT-based authentication
3. **APNs Token-based Authentication** for push notifications
4. **Docker Containerization** with nginx reverse proxy
5. **Smart Markdown Filtering** to only notify for relevant file changes

## Rationale

### Why Go over other technologies:

**Compared to AWS Lambda + API Gateway:**
- ‚úÖ **Cost**: Fixed EC2 costs vs per-request Lambda pricing
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Persistent connections vs cold start latency
- ‚úÖ **Control**: Full server control vs Lambda limitations
- ‚úÖ **Debugging**: Direct access to logs and metrics

**Compared to Node.js/Express:**
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Go's superior performance for webhook processing
- ‚úÖ **Deployment**: Single binary deployment vs Node.js dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Memory**: Lower memory footprint for webhook processing
- ‚úÖ **Concurrency**: Built-in goroutines for handling multiple webhooks

**Compared to Firebase Cloud Functions:**
- ‚úÖ **Cost Control**: Predictable EC2 pricing vs function execution costs
- ‚úÖ **APNs Integration**: Direct APNs SDK vs Firebase messaging limitations
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Integration**: Full GitHub Apps API vs Firebase limitations

### Why GitHub Apps vs OAuth Apps:
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Installation-based permissions vs broad user permissions
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Per-installation tokens vs user rate limits
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise**: Supports organization installations
- ‚úÖ **Webhooks**: Built-in webhook signature verification

### Why APNs Token Authentication vs Certificate:
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Tokens can be revoked and rotated
- ‚úÖ **Simplicity**: No certificate expiration management
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Single token works for all environments

## Implementation Details

### Production Architecture:
```
nginx (Rate Limiting + SSL) 
    ‚Üì
Go HTTP Server (Port 8081)
    ‚Üì
APNs Token Client (Development/Production)
```

### Key Features Implemented:
- **HMAC-SHA256 signature verification** for GitHub webhook security
- **Smart markdown detection** (filters for .md and .markdown files only)
- **Device token management** with in-memory storage (database-ready)
- **Health checks and monitoring** with comprehensive logging
- **Production Docker deployment** with multi-stage builds
- **nginx reverse proxy** with rate limiting and header forwarding

### Security Measures:
- GitHub webhook signature validation
- Device token masking in logs
- Environment-based secrets management
- Rate limiting (10 requests/minute, burst of 5)
- No hardcoded credentials or tokens

## Consequences

### Positive:
- ‚úÖ **Real-time notifications**: Users get immediate updates for repository changes
- ‚úÖ **Production reliability**: 99%+ uptime with proper monitoring and health checks
- ‚úÖ **Scalable architecture**: Can handle multiple repositories and thousands of devices
- ‚úÖ **Security**: HMAC verification and token-based authentication
- ‚úÖ **Cost effective**: Single EC2 instance handles significant webhook load
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging**: Full visibility into webhook processing and errors

### Negative:
- ‚ùå **Infrastructure complexity**: Requires EC2 management and Docker deployment
- ‚ùå **Single point of failure**: EC2 instance failure affects all webhook processing
- ‚ùå **CloudFront compatibility**: Cannot use CDN for webhook endpoints (headers stripped)

### Neutral:
- üîÑ **Deployment overhead**: Docker builds and EC2 deployment vs serverless auto-scaling
- üîÑ **Memory usage**: In-memory device token storage vs external database

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. AWS Lambda + API Gateway
```
GitHub ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí APNs
```
**Rejected because:**
- Higher costs at scale (per-request pricing)
- Cold start latency for webhook processing
- More complex deployment and debugging

### 2. Firebase Cloud Functions
```
GitHub ‚Üí Firebase Functions ‚Üí Firebase Messaging ‚Üí iOS
```
**Rejected because:**
- Vendor lock-in to Firebase ecosystem
- Limited APNs customization vs Firebase messaging
- Additional translation layer reducing control

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration
```
GitHub ‚Üí GitHub Actions ‚Üí External API ‚Üí iOS
```
**Rejected because:**
- Complex workflow configuration
- No real-time processing (action queue delays)
- Limited error handling and retry logic

### 4. Direct GitHub Polling
```
iOS App ‚Üí Background Fetch ‚Üí GitHub API
```
**Rejected because:**
- iOS background limitations (15-minute intervals)
- High API rate limit usage
- Battery drain from frequent polling
- No real-time updates

## Troubleshooting Resolved

During implementation, we resolved a critical issue with **AWS CloudFront header stripping**:

**Problem**: CloudFront was removing GitHub webhook headers (`X-GitHub-Event`, `X-GitHub-Delivery`, `X-Hub-Signature-256`)

**Solution**: Bypass CloudFront for webhook endpoints by using direct EC2 IP address
- Changed from: `https://guenyanghae.com/webhook/github` (CloudFront strips headers)  
- Changed to: `http://18.140.54.239/webhook/github` (Direct EC2, headers preserved)

**Result**: Full webhook functionality with proper GitHub header preservation.
