# Known Issues & Non-Critical Bugs

This document tracks known issues that don't affect core functionality but may need attention in future releases.

## Audio & TTS Issues

### GryphonVoice MobileAsset Query Error
**Status**: Non-Critical  
**Error**: `Query for com.apple.MobileAsset.VoiceServices.GryphonVoice failed: 2`  
**Date Identified**: 2025-08-16

**Description:**
iOS fails to download highest-quality neural TTS voices (GryphonVoice) from Apple's servers, resulting in debug console errors.

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **No functional impact**: App continues working with premium voices (e.g., Daniel, Ava, Samantha)
- ‚úÖ **Voice quality**: Still excellent with 47+ enhanced voices available
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Debug noise**: Creates error messages in development console

**Root Cause:**
- Network connectivity issues with Apple's voice asset servers
- iOS version compatibility with specific neural voice models
- Simulator vs device differences in voice asset availability
- Temporary server unavailability for premium voice downloads

**Current Behavior:**
- App automatically falls back to available premium/enhanced voices
- Voice selection works correctly (confirmed: "üéµ Selected premium voice: Daniel")
- No user-visible impact or degraded experience

**Potential Solutions:**
1. **Voice Availability Detection**: Check voice availability before attempting selection
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Suppress non-critical voice download errors
3. **Voice Download Management**: Proactive voice asset management
4. **User Notification**: Optional voice quality status for power users

**Priority**: Low (P3)  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Recommended Timeline**: Future enhancement (not current sprint)

**Workaround:**
None needed - current fallback mechanism handles this gracefully.

- Integration Issues
- Platform-Specific Issues

**Note**: Critical bugs that affect core functionality should be tracked in GitHub Issues or the main todo system, not this document.
